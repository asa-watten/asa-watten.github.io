I am an economist and a post-doc at [Yale School of the Environment](https://environment.yale.edu/). My research focuses on the microeconomics of energy and climate innovation: Who adopts new technologies and why? How can the government direct—and speed up—technical change? How do manufacturers and innovators respond to both policy and politics? I use a combination of economic modeling and causal inference to investigate these questions.

Prior to Yale, I was a research fellow at the Environmental Protection Agency where I worked on cars, including [light and medium-duty vehicle rule making](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/proposed-rule-multi-pollutant-emissions-standards-model), and environmental justice questions. I earned my Ph.D. in [Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics](https://afre.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. I also hold degrees from The University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon University. Before graduate school, I ran a small biofuel company^[[Details.](figs/details.png)] in Braddock, Pennsylvania.^[Now famously the home of Senator John Fetterman who was [mayor at the time.](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-mayor-hell-allegheny-county-100493/)]

I am on the job market. Here is my [research statment](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mrwu4gb3v0yous9xeilt8/Watten-Research-Statement.pdf?rlkey=fvhotxk52akobbm2psjrpgqe7&dl=0), and my [job market paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/acxjy6un9a2efaabdjc27/Attributes_Watten_Anderson_Helfand.pdf?rlkey=l9uhir9a36qc63vhndw2ynfti&dl=0).
